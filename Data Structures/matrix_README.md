Matrix.h,matrix.cpp contain my implementation of a matrix structure. The matrix structure I implemented has the following properties: add,

subtract, multiply, transpose, scalar multiplication, resize, quarter, swap_row, transpose, ==, and !=. matrix_main.cpp contains tests 

which utilize the properties of the data structure.
